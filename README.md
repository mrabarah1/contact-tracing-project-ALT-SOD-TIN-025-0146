# Contact Tracing and Exposure Analysis System 
# A Python-based system to track interactions and identify high-risk individuals based on exposure to infected persons.

## Concepts Applied
* **Data Cleaning**: Stripping Whitespace from user input.
* **Dictionaries**: Mapping names to infection statuses 
* **Lists And Tuples**: Storing contact events as immutable records.
* **Data Aggregation**: Summing exposure durations across multiple events.
* **Sorting**: Organizing risk reports by duration using lambda functions.


## How to Run
Run the script diectly using Python:
```bash
python contact_tracing.py


## Sample Output
Exposure Report
----------------
Total People: 9
Total Contact Events: 9
Infected People: 5
High Risk Individuals: 1
Top Exposures: 
 - Bayo exposed to Wale for 15 minutes
